## About
This is a server for contact tracing which is tracking which people have had coronavirus and notifying people who have been in close proximity to these people to seek testing. Contact tracing could potentially help slow down the spread of the coronavirus by identifying prone areas fast. Unfortunately, this would have worked very good during the beginning stages of the coronavirus but it can still have an impact now. 

## How to run
This server only uses the standard library of python so you just have to execute 

``python3 main.py``


This will result in the computer hosting a contact tracing server.
